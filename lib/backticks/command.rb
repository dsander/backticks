module Backticks
  # Represents a running process; provides mechanisms for capturing the process's
  # output, passing input, waiting for the process to end, and learning its
  # exitstatus.

  # Interactive commands print their output to Ruby's STDOUT and STDERR
  # in realtime, and also pass input from Ruby's STDIN to the command's stdin.
